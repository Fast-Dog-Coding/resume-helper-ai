# Resume Assistant Chatbot

Ask an AI about Grant's skills and work experience.

## Overview
The Resume Assistant Chatbot is a simple web application that allows users to query an AI about a Grant Lindsay's resume and work experience. The chatbot sends user questions to an AI (OpenAI's ChatGPT) and displays the responses in a chat-like interface.

## Purpose
This application was built to showcase Grant's skills in using emerging technologies, such as AI, and to demonstrate his ability to create interactive, full-stack web applications.

## How to Use

[Try it for yourself](https://resume-bot.fastdogcoding.com/).

## How to Run Your Own Version
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Create an `.env` file with your API keys. (See `sample.env` for reference.) 
    - You will need an OpenAI developer account and a MongoDB account. (Or you can remove the MongoDB code, since it is used only for logging.)

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3100` to access the chatbot interface.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface
